## Requirements

```spec-requirements
- id: reqllm.package.multi_provider_api
  statement: ReqLlmNext shall provide a unified public API for text generation, structured output, streaming, embeddings, and supported media operations across supported model providers using the same operations whether callers start from an `LLMDB` `model_spec` string or an `%LLMDB.Model{}`, including handcrafted structs used for local development.
  priority: must
  stability: evolving

- id: reqllm.package.fixture_replay
  statement: ReqLlmNext shall verify package behavior with deterministic automated tests that exercise provider scenarios and replay recorded fixtures by default, preserving the recorded execution surface when fixtures were captured against an older but still valid endpoint shape, including request-style fixtures for non-stream image, transcription, and speech operations, while keeping sparse live verifier tests as an explicit opt-in integration lane instead of broad live CI coverage.
  priority: must
  stability: evolving

- id: reqllm.package.execution_planning
  statement: ReqLlmNext shall route supported requests through a deterministic planning path that normalizes model facts into `ModelProfile`, request intent into `ExecutionMode`, selects explicit `ExecutionSurface` support through compatibility-aware policy, validates surface-specific parameter compatibility, materializes an `ExecutionPlan`, and resolves an execution stack of provider, session runtime, semantic protocol, wire, and transport modules before runtime execution, with provider facts, runtime-module lookup, and surface catalog construction driven from the compiled extension manifest rather than central provider branching.
  priority: must
  stability: evolving

- id: reqllm.package.buffered_stream_metadata
  statement: When ReqLlmNext buffers a streamed response into the canonical `Response` shape, it shall preserve terminal metadata such as finish reason and provider-facing response identifiers emitted by the canonical stream, and the same shared output-item materialization path shall drive explicit result-channel and helper extraction for streamed text, thinking, usage, transcripts, audio chunks, provider items, refusals, annotations, and tool calls so normalization stays consistent across buffered and streaming consumers.
  priority: should
  stability: evolving

- id: reqllm.package.model_slice_verification
  statement: ReqLlmNext shall be able to lock supported scenario sets to explicit starter-model slices and curated provider support-matrix lanes, including alternative transport lanes where relevant, so provider-specific support stays visible as the planning path evolves without exploding into a one-file-per-model matrix.
  priority: should
  stability: evolving

- id: reqllm.package.local_env_loading
  statement: ReqLlmNext shall support local development and replay or live verification by loading a local `.env` file without overriding shell-provided environment variables, so API keys can be supplied for tests and compatibility runs without being committed.
  priority: should
  stability: evolving

- id: reqllm.package.provider_specific_utilities
  statement: ReqLlmNext shall keep the top-level cross-provider facade narrow while exposing explicit provider-scoped utility modules for non-canonical provider endpoints such as Anthropic token counting, files, batches, and provider-native tool helpers including web search, web fetch, code execution, MCP, and computer use.
  priority: should
  stability: evolving

- id: reqllm.package.provider_native_input_isolation
  statement: ReqLlmNext shall keep canonical cross-provider tool input on `ReqLlmNext.Tool`, allow provider-native helper maps only on the owning provider surfaces, and fail early during planning when foreign raw maps or provider-native helper shapes are used on the wrong surface, including provider-native Responses helpers such as Anthropic-native tool helpers on Anthropic surfaces and xAI built-in tool helpers on xAI Responses surfaces.
  priority: must
  stability: evolving

- id: reqllm.package.compile_time_extensions
  statement: ReqLlmNext shall move provider and model edge-case support toward a compile-time extension manifest with provider registrations, explicit provider default families, global fallback families, family inheritance for reusing a happy-path stack, narrow opt-in override rules, manifest-backed provider facts and surface catalogs, built-in declaration packs discovered from co-located family and provider slice homes, session-runtime seams, realtime adapter seams, provider-local media family overrides where needed, and compile-time manifest verification so common paths stay simple while edge cases remain explicit, allowing providers such as DeepSeek, Groq, OpenRouter, vLLM, and xAI to ride OpenAI-compatible families while declaring only the provider-local deltas they need.
  priority: should
  stability: evolving

- id: reqllm.package.runtime_telemetry
  statement: ReqLlmNext shall expose a stable `ReqLlmNext.Telemetry` kernel for request, plan, execution-stack, stream, provider-request, fixture, and realtime instrumentation so application code and compat tooling can observe the runtime without parsing provider-specific payloads.
  priority: should
  stability: evolving

- id: reqllm.package.utility_proof_depth
  statement: Provider-owned utility helpers shall keep representative request-execution proof lanes in addition to builder-level tests so files, batches, vector stores, background flows, and similar non-canonical utilities stay honest about their integration depth without pretending to be part of the cross-provider facade.
  priority: should
  stability: evolving

- id: reqllm.package.live_verifier_lane
  statement: ReqLlmNext shall keep a dedicated sparse live verifier lane for representative Anthropic and OpenAI integration checks so provider drift and fixture-refresh sanity can be exercised explicitly without expanding the replay-backed default suite or requiring live-provider access in normal CI.
  priority: should
  stability: evolving

- id: reqllm.package.zoi_struct_contracts
  statement: ReqLlmNext shall standardize package-owned structs on Zoi-backed schemas rather than plain `defstruct` declarations so canonical package, planning, response, runtime-state, and extension-manifest contracts expose explicit schema metadata, enforced required keys, and stable defaults.
  priority: should
  stability: evolving
