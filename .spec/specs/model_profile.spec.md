## Requirements

```spec-requirements
- id: reqllm.model_profile.descriptive_facts
  statement: ReqLlmNext shall normalize resolved model metadata into a request-independent `ModelProfile` that describes operations, features, modalities, limits, parameter defaults, constraints metadata, and session capabilities without choosing concrete request behavior, including manifest-backed provider-scoped descriptive fact extraction for normalized features such as Anthropic structured outputs, citations, context management, additional document input, provider-owned media operation support, Google distinctions between Gemini chat, embedding, dedicated image-generation, and obviously non-chat long-tail families, and OpenAI-compatible provider deltas such as DeepSeek chat or reasoning behavior, Groq transcription-media routing, OpenRouter routing-aware chat overrides, xAI responses-first versus image-media routing plus native-structured-output support by model generation, and self-hosted providers such as vLLM that intentionally ride the shared OpenAI-compatible family without custom wire or protocol overrides, plus the resolved extension family id selected by declarative criteria and provider or global fallback rules or by typed `LLMDB.Model.execution` metadata for best-effort providers when no dedicated provider registration exists.
  priority: must
  stability: evolving

- id: reqllm.model_profile.execution_surfaces_declared
  statement: `ModelProfile` shall declare explicit named `ExecutionSurface` entries for supported endpoint styles instead of implying support from independent protocol, wire-format, and transport lists, including multiple transport variants for one semantic family when the provider truly supports them, allowing one provider-owned media catalog to emit several explicit media-operation surfaces when the provider facts already disambiguate which family is active, and carrying an explicit owning family id on each surface whether that surface came from an extension-backed catalog or the generic typed-metadata best-effort catalog.
  priority: must
  stability: evolving

- id: reqllm.model_profile.request_independent
  statement: `ModelProfile` shall remain request-independent, serializable, and safe to cache, and it shall not contain chosen surfaces, prompt state, continuation state, session runtime handles, or network handles.
  priority: must
  stability: evolving
```
